# Zindi-New-User-Engagement

_**Introcution**_
1. Zindi is the first data science competition platform in Africa which hosts an entire data science ecosystem of scientists, engineers, academics, companies, NGOs, governments and institutions.​
2. The data which is provided to us is a part of Zindi user activity.​
3. Our task is to determine if a new user will be active in the upcoming month using the data of their previous months.​
4. This helps Zindi track the user activity and improve the platform.

_**Problem Definition**_
To build a model that, given data of the user activity of month of sign up, can predict
user activity for the upcoming month.

_**Objectives**_
1. To perform data analysis and identify criteria for what constitutes an active user.​

2. To build a model to predict whether the user will engage in the Zindi platform in the upcoming month, based on their activity in the previous months.

_**Proposed Methodology**_
1. Classify a user as active or inactive in a particular month. ​
* KMeans clustering​
* Criteria​
2. Approaches to solve this problem​
* Concatenate each month user activity as new columns​
* Data as sequence​
* Activity Based Grouping​
3. Model Building

_**Conclusion**_
* We performed data analysis to decide which features help determine user activity and how they affect user activity.​
* Using this information, we derived a criteria for classifying user as active or inactive.​
* Finally, we came up with approaches to solve this problem and built models to predict user activity in the upcoming month.
